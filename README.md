# Bioinformatics Contest 2021
Found out about this contest pretty late and thus didn't have enough time to finish the problems to qualify for the final round. Nonetheless, was a fun first time experience scoring 1 point short of qualifying for the final round and definitely learnt quite a bit about algorithms which I haven't touched since my programming introductory classes. Will be spending some free time to work on the problems at my leisure for learning purposes. 

More information about the contest can be found at this [link](https://stepik.org/course/91751/info). The contest was organised by [Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.me/) and ITMO University and supported by JetBrains, Genotek, Yandex, and Serokell.
